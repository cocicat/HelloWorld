    <h1> Hello World </h1>
    <p>I chose this class because I enjoy working with computers. Coding has become somewhat of a hobby of mine, but I don't think I am skilled enough to make a career off of it or become a computer engineer. I think that coding and web design is a beneficial skill in almost any work environment. I hear that experience in coding looks very good on job applications. </p>
